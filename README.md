# jump
repo for jump?
Project Lead Developer: Tyler Layton
Software Development Lead: Benson Cheng

This game is code in python using the pygame library. The game creates a transparent background where the windows behind the game window can still be seen. 
This can me used in zoom meetings, when watching videos, or if you are just bored. The player must control the character to jump to the next platform 
and complete the level. Future updates coming soon!
