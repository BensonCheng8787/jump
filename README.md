# jump
repo for "jump?", created for RCOS project fall 2023.
“jump?”
Description:
Our game “jump?” will be a chrome extension written in javascript and HTML. The main goal of
the game is to have it “transparent” so the screen behind the game is still being shown. This
creates the illusion that the character is moving around the screen. This will be a parkour game
where the character climbs the right side of the screen, goes across the top and down the left
side of the screen. This will be a work in progress game and the idea may change a little as we
go, but this is our main idea. We will also make the platforms only appear when the character is
close by so the screen is not blocked completely. If milestones are completed early we may
push the schedule up. Since this is a small group, we will be working on this mostly together so
we don't have individual milestones.

Goals/milestones:
Team: Tyler Layton, Benson Cheng
1. September/October:
● Get the base game working, have platforms and character movement defined to
small fixed-size windows
● basic functions of the game, jumping, moving, and start/pause/end.
2. October/November:
● Adapt the game window to disappear/ appear based on the character’s location,
to create an illusion of a moving window.
● Continue working on game improving movement and other capabilities
3. November/December:
● Expand the game, to circle the display, to have the character go around the main
window while the environment appears and disappears around the character.
● Have the area where the map is invisible refresh and generate new platforms/
obstacles, so the next time the player enters the area a new course will be
present.
● Possibly add other game mechanics, enemies, dangers, etc
